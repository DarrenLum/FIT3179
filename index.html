  stress and life and alcohol dependency occurs. Females have less suicidal death but more suicidal thoughts. As females are more open with their feelings, they are able
  voice out their opinions reducing stress. Also, the <b>suicidal method they use are less violent</b> such as cutting themselves which can be treated if early actions are 
    taken (Schumacher, 2019).</p>
