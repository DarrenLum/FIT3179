  <h2> Suicide Rate by Gender and Generation</h2>
  <p> Males are more likely to die from suicide compared to females. 40% of countries have more than 15 suicide deaths per 100,000 men. Men have higher success in suicide 
  due to violent method used that completes the act. Men tends to bottle up their feelings due to the expectation put onto men where they have to be strong. This causes
  stress and life and alcohol dependency occurs. Females have less suicidal death but more suicidal thoughts. As females are more open with their feelings, they are able
  voice out their opinions reducing stress. Also, the suicidal method they use are less violent such as cutting themselves which can be treated if early actions are 
    taken (Schumacher, 2019).</p>
